## Problem of Interest:
Why are we doing this study?

  define RV of interest: number of free throws made
  define the parameter of interest: free throw true shooting percentage
  
## Define Model
  
  Prior Probability Distribution: pi(theta) ~ Beta
  Likelihood: f(x|theta)
  
## Derive the Posterior Distribution

  Posterior: pi(theta|x)
  
## Apply to problem of interest

  Make decisions baded on posterior
  summarize posterior dist to help
