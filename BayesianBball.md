I am making a dashboard in shiny that will input my free throws and update my free throw true shooting percentage using bayesian statistics. 

## Problem of Interest
Why are we doing this study?
  
  define RV of interest: number of free throws made out of 10
  define the parameter of interest: free throw true shooting percentage
  assumptions: we have to assume independence of each free throw. In reality, when you make five in a row, your confidence increases and      will affect the next shots.
  
## Define Model
  
  Prior Probability Distribution: pi(theta) ~ Beta
  Likelihood: f(x|theta)
  
## Derive the Posterior Distribution

  Posterior: pi(theta|x)
  
## Apply to Problem of Interest

  Make decisions baded on posterior
  summarize posterior dist to help
