## Sleep Cycle Analysis 
Jonathan Chia, Krystine Osumo, Gregory Pollock 


 

**Introduction** 
The purpose of our experiment was to gain information about what affects sleep quality using the Sleep Cycle application’s measure of sleep quality. Because we conducted an observational study, we can only conclude correlation and assume that Jonathan’s data is representative of a typical college student. We looked at the effects of total time slept and the season of the year on sleep quality. The principle questions of interest were: “Does the amount you sleep affect your overall sleep quality?” and “Does the season of the year affect your overall sleep quality?” Our initial assumptions were that Sleep quality will increase when you sleep more, student will have better sleep quality in spring/summer compared to fall/winter, there may not be a difference between 89 hours of sleep versus more than 9 hours, and that there will be an interaction between season and amount of sleep. 
 
**Design and Data Collection**
**Null Hypothesis / Alternative Hypothesis** Our three null hypotheses assume: that there is no difference in mean sleep quality between Fall, Winter and Spring / Summer seasons, that there is no difference in mean sleep quality when sleeping between 5 - 7.25 hours, 7.25 - 8 hours , 8 - 9 hours  and sleeping more than 9 hours, and that there is no interaction between the seasons and the amount of sleep.  As our alternative hypothesis, we assume that at least one mean sleep quality measure differs from the rest of the seasons; we also assume that at least one mean sleep quality measure differs from the rest of the amount of sleep. We also assume that there is an interaction between the two factors.    Model We performed a 2 factor Anova Test with Sleep Quality as our response variable. The two factors are: Hours Jonathan Slept (4 levels: 5 - 7.25 hrs, 7.25 - 8 hrs, 8-9 hrs, 9+ hrs) and Seasons (3 levels: Fall, Spring and Summer, Winter). Below is our model where Yijk represents the observation, μ represents the grand average of all levels, 𝛼i  represents the season effect with i level, βj represents the amount of sleep effect with j levels, 𝛼iβj  represents the interaction effect between season effect and amount of sleep effect and εijk  represents the effect of random error. 
Yijk= μ + 𝛼i + βj + 𝛼iβj + εijk 
 
Because this is an observational study, we used power analyses to find what differences in sleep quality are statistically possible to detect. The within.variance is the variance of the response variable, the sleep quality. The between variance was calculated assuming that we want to detect a difference of at least 2.5% between Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter as well as detect a difference of at least 5% between each level of time sleeping.  With at least 9 replications in each cell, we can detect a difference of 2.5% in sleep quality with a power of about 90%.
