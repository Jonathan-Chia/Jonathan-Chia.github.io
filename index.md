I am a senior at Brigham Young University, an aspiring data scientist, and investing enthusiast. 

My skills include running statistical analyses, coding in R or Python, using technology to improve efficiency, time management, teaching Chinese, and concocting healthy and delicious smoothies. I love basketball, volleyball, ping pong, learning Korean, composing piano pieces, teaching violin, and playing Chinese chess. 

This website contains some of my favorite data projects. Feel free to ask questions or comment on my projects.
