I am a junior at Brigham Young University, an aspiring data scientist/financial analyst, and investing enthusiast. I believe a happy life comes through stability, balance, communication, and organization.

My skills include running statistical analyses, coding on R, using technology to improve efficiency, time management, teaching Chinese, and concocting healthy and delicious smoothies.

I love basketball, volleyball, ping pong, learning Korean, composing piano pieces, teaching violin, and playing Chinese chess. After a volunteer church service mission in Taiwan, I learned that there is a lot more to life than becoming a millionaire, so I am currently searching for a career path that can make a difference and provide balance.
